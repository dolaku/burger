# Eat-Da-Burger!

A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!).
* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the page -- waiting to be devoured.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has an `Eat it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will be disabled from being eaten again.
* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
